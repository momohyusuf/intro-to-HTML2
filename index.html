          Cristiano Ronaldo is a Portuguese professional footballer widely
          considered one of the greatest players in the history of the sport.
          Born on February 5, 1985, in Funchal, Madeira, Portugal, his full name
          is Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro. Ronaldo's career began at
          Sporting Lisbon in Portugal before he caught the eye of Manchester
          United, where he played from 2003 to 2009. During his time at
          Manchester United, he won three English Premier League titles and the
          UEFA Champions League in the 2007-2008 season. In 2008, he was awarded
          the FIFA World Player of the Year. In 2009, Ronaldo made a
          high-profile move to Real Madrid for what was then a world-record
          transfer fee. His time with Real Madrid was highly successful, and he
          became the club's all-time leading scorer. Ronaldo won numerous
          domestic and international titles with Real Madrid, including four
          Champions League titles. In 2018, Ronaldo made a surprising transfer
          to Juventus in Italy's Serie A. He continued to showcase his
          goal-scoring prowess and leadership on the field. Ronaldo has also
          been a key figure for the Portuguese national team, earning caps in
          multiple UEFA European Championships and FIFA World Cups. He helped
          Portugal win the UEFA Euro 2016 tournament and has been an integral
          part of their success. Ronaldo is known for his incredible
          goal-scoring ability, athleticism, versatility, and dedication to
          fitness. Off the field, he is involved in various charitable
          activities and has a significant presence on social media. Please note
          that developments in Ronaldo's career or personal life after January
          2022 would not be included in this biography.
